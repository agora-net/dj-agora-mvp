            <h2>Section I - Name, Seat, Duration and Purpose of the Association</h2>

            <p class="font-bold">Article 1: Name, Seat, Duration</p>
            <p>
                Under the name "Agora", there exists an association in accordance with
                the provisions of the Swiss Civil Code, with its seat in the city of
                Lucerne (the Association).
            </p>
            <p>The duration of the Association is unlimited.</p>

            <p class="font-bold">Article 2: Purpose</p>
            <p>
                The Association is a non-profit organization dedicated to fostering
                trust on the internet, ensuring it remains a global public resource for
                all.
            </p>
            <p>
                To this end, the Association shall promote the creation,
                standardization, and public adoption of open, secure, and user-centric
                technologies. This may include developing software, creating educational
                resources, organizing events, and engaging in any other activities that
                serve the Association's purpose.

            <h2>Section II - Membership</h2>

            <p class="font-bold">Article 3: Membership, Admission, Register of Members</p>
            <p>
                Members of the Association may be Swiss and foreign natural and legal
                persons, including public law institutions and corporations.
            </p>
            <p>
                The application for admission as a member of the Association must be
                addressed to the Board in the form determined by the Board, which shall
                decide finally on the admission at its discretion. The Board may refuse
                the application without stating any reasons.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Board shall maintain a register of members in which the members'
                names, addresses, and e-mail addresses are entered. In relation to the
                Association, only those persons who are entered in the register of
                members shall be considered members.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a person entered in the register of members changes their name,
                address, or e-mail address, they must notify the Board of this change.
                Communications from the Association shall be deemed to have been validly
                made if they are sent to the contact information recorded in the
                register of members.
            </p>

            <p class="font-bold">Article 4: Resignation, Expulsion, Suspension</p>
            <p>
                Membership shall terminate upon resignation, expulsion, and death (in
                the case of natural persons) or loss of legal personality (in the case
                of legal persons).
            </p>
            <p>
                Resignation from the Association is possible with three months' notice
                to the end of a month. The notice of resignation must be sent to the
                Board in writing or in another form determined by the Board. A
                resignation does not affect the obligation to pay the membership fee for
                the current fiscal year.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Board may definitively expel a member from the Association who fails
                to pay the membership fee in due time even after a written reminder.
                Instead of expulsion, the Board may also order a suspension of
                membership (including voting rights) until the outstanding amount has
                been paid in full.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, the Board may expel a member who, in the Board's opinion,
                acts contrary to the interests of the Association. In this case, the
                expulsion shall be effected by a resolution passed by a majority of
                two-thirds of all Board members and by written notification to the
                member concerned, stating the reason for the expulsion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before making a decision on expulsion, the Board shall grant the member
                concerned the right to be heard.
            </p>
            <p>
                The expelled member may appeal against a decision of expulsion by the
                Board pursuant to paragraph 4 to the next General Assembly within 30
                calendar days from the date of the written notification. The appeal must
                be submitted to the Board in writing. The member concerned shall be
                suspended (including voting rights) until the next General Assembly. The
                General Assembly shall decide definitively on the approval of the appeal
                by the usual majority. If the appeal is approved, the membership of the
                expelled member is reinstated, and the member concerned cannot be
                expelled again for the same reason for one year from the date of the
                decision of the General Assembly.

                Assembly can be validly discussed and resolved, as long as all members
                are present and the Board members have been invited and are either
                present or have waived their right to participate.
            </p>

            <p class="font-bold">Article 11: Chair, Tellers, Minutes</p>

                chairperson shall be elected by the General Assembly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The chairperson of the General Assembly shall appoint a secretary and
                the tellers, all of whom need not be members. The minutes shall be
                signed by the chairperson and the secretary.
            </p>
            <p>
                The chairperson of the General Assembly has all the powers of direction

            </p>
            <p>
                Any member may make procedural motions during the General Assembly. The
                General Assembly shall decide on procedural questions by immediate
                resolution; in doing so, it may deviate from the chairperson's
                instructions.
            </p>

            <p class="font-bold">Article 12: Voting Rights, Representation of Members</p>

                A member may be represented at the General Assembly by its legal
                representative or, by means of a power of attorney, by another
                authorized person who must also be a member of the Association. However,
                the Board may also admit third parties who are not members of the
                Association as authorized persons. If the member is a legal entity, the
                above restriction does not apply to its corporate bodies, employees, and
                other permanent representatives.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Board may issue rules of procedure regarding participation and
                representation at the General Assembly and shall regulate the
                requirements for powers of attorney and instructions.
            </p>

            <p class="font-bold">Article 13: Resolutions, Elections</p>
            <p>
                All duly convened General Assemblies shall have a quorum irrespective of
                the number of members present or validly represented.
            </p>
            <p>
                The General Assembly passes resolutions and elects by an absolute
                majority of the valid votes cast (excluding abstentions), unless the law
                or these Bylaws provide otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
                If an election is not successful in the first ballot and there is more
                than one candidate, the chairperson of the General Assembly shall order
                a second ballot in which the relative majority shall decide.
            </p>
            <p>
                Voting and elections shall be held by open ballot, unless the General
                Assembly or its chairperson decides that they shall be held by secret
                ballot.
            </p>
            <p>
                The chairperson of the General Assembly may at any time have a vote or
                election repeated if, in his or her opinion, there is doubt as to the
                result of the vote; in this case, the previous vote or election shall be
                deemed not to have taken place.
            </p>

            <p class="font-bold">Article 14: Important Resolutions</p>
            <p>
                A resolution of the General Assembly passed by at least two-thirds of
                the valid votes cast (excluding abstentions) is required for:

            </ul>
            <p>
                Provisions of the Bylaws that stipulate greater majorities for the
                passing of certain resolutions than those prescribed by law may only be
                introduced or repealed with the required majority.

                approval of the applicable majority of the members who validly respond
                (excluding abstentions) to a proposal shall be equivalent to a
                resolution of the General Assembly.

            <h3>B. The Board</h3>
            <p class="font-bold">Article 16: Members of the Board</p>

            </p>
            <p>
                All members of the Board shall disclose their interests in an

            <p class="font-bold">Article 17: Election and Term of Office</p>
            <p>
                The Board members appointed by the founding members are elected for a
                fixed term of three years, calculated from the date of the Association's
                foundation. Thereafter, ordinary elections for members of the Board
                shall be held by the General Assembly every three years for a term of
                office of three years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Board members who are elected to the Board by the General Assembly on an
                extraordinary basis, i.e., on a date not coinciding with an ordinary
                election date, shall only be elected for the remainder of the term of
