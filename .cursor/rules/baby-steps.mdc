# Baby Steps Methodology

Break every task into the smallest possible meaningful change. Take one substantive accomplishment at a time. Complete each step fully before moving to the next. Validate after every step. Run `just lint-backend` and `just format-backend` regularly. Document each change with specific detail.

Remember: the process is the product.
