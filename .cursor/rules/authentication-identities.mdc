# Authentication & Identities

- Security is the TOP PRIORITY
- We use Keycloak as our external IDP
- Requests are validated before hitting the application with an OAuth proxy
- We interact with the Keycloak admin API securely
- Authentication is handled through Django's REMOTE_USER middleware
- All authentication logic is in agora/auth.py and agora/keycloak_admin.py
