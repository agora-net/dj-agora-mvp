empty line as separator
<optional body>
empty line as separator

```

### Initial Commit

```plaintext
chore: init
```

Merge branch '<branch name>'
```

### Revert Commit

```plaintext
Revert "<reverted commit subject line>"
```

### Types

- Changes relevant to the API or UI:
  - `feat` Commits that add, adjust or remove a new feature to the API or UI
  - `fix` Commits that fix an API or UI bug of a preceded `feat` commit
- `refactor` Commits that rewrite or restructure code without altering API or UI behavior
  - `perf` Commits are special type of `refactor` commits that specifically improve performance
- `style` Commits that address code style (e.g., white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons) and do not affect application behavior
- `test` Commits that add missing tests or correct existing ones
- `docs` Commits that exclusively affect documentation
- `build` Commits that affect build-related components such as build tools, dependencies, project version, CI/CD pipelines, ...
- `ops` Commits that affect operational components like infrastructure, deployment, backup, recovery procedures, ...
- `chore` Miscellaneous commits e.g. modifying `.gitignore`, ...

### Scopes

The `scope` provides additional contextual information.

- The scope is an **optional** part
- Allowed scopes vary and are typically defined by the specific project
- **Do not** use issue identifiers as scopes

### Breaking Changes Indicator

- A commit that introduce breaking changes **must** be indicated by an `!` before the `:` in the subject line e.g. `feat(api)!: remove status endpoint`
- Breaking changes **should** be described in the [commit footer section](#footer), if the [commit description](#description) isn't sufficiently informative

### Description

The `description` contains a concise description of the change.

- The description is a **mandatory** part
- Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
  - Think of `This commit will...` or `This commit should...`
- **Do not** capitalize the first letter
- **Do not** end the description with a period (`.`)
- I case of breaking changes also see [breaking changes indicator](#breaking-changes-indicator)

### Body

The `body` should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

- The body is an **optional** part
- Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"

### Footer

The `footer` should contain issue references and informations about **Breaking Changes**

- The footer is an **optional** part, except if the commit introduce breaking changes
- _Optionally_ reference issue identifiers (e.g., `Closes #123`, `Fixes JIRA-456`)
- **Breaking Changes** **must** start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:`
  - For a single line description just add a space after `BREAKING CHANGE:`
  - For a multi line description add two new lines after `BREAKING CHANGE:`

### Versioning

- **If** your next release contains commit with...
  - **Breaking Changes** incremented the **major version**
  - **API relevant changes** (`feat` or `fix`) incremented the **minor version**
- **Else** increment the **patch version**
