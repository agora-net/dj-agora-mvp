# Project Specifics

- This project uses Python's `uv` package manager. Never use pip or poetry. You should use the modern uv syntax, for example, to install a package you use `uv add <package_name>`.
- The project's tasks are tracked in docs/tasks.md
- The README and project-management should always be kept up to date.
