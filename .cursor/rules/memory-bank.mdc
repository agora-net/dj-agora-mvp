# Memory Bank

Core files maintain project knowledge across sessions:

- `projectBrief.md` - Project foundation and scope
- `productContext.md` - Why it exists, problems solved
- `systemPatterns.md` - Architecture and design patterns
- `techContext.md` - Technologies, constraints, setup
- `activeContext.md` - Current work, recent changes, next steps
- `progress.md` - What works, what's left, known issues

Update memory bank when discovering new patterns, after significant changes, or when explicitly requested with "update memory bank" (review ALL files).

After every session reset, read ALL memory bank files immediately. This is your only link to previous work.
