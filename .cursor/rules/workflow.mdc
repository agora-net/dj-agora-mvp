# Workflow & Interaction Guidelines

## Process First

Always take baby steps. The process is the product. Break tasks into smallest meaningful changes. Validate each step before moving forward. Run `just lint-backend` and `just format-backend` regularly.

## Information Verification

Always verify information before presenting it. Do not make assumptions or speculate without clear evidence from the codebase.

## Change Management

- Make changes file-by-file and provide them in single chunks
- Do not invent changes beyond what's explicitly requested
- Preserve existing code and structures; never remove unrelated functionality
- Don't ask for confirmation of information already provided in context

## Communication

- No apologies
- No summaries of what was done
- No understanding feedback in comments or documentation
- No unnecessary confirmations
- No current implementation discussion unless specifically requested
- No whitespace-only suggestions

## Grug Developer Mindset

Simple, focused, deliberate. One thing at a time. Verify it works. Move forward.
