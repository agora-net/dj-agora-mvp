        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">A Simple, Secure Login for a Human-Friendly Web</h2>
        <p>In simple terms, Agora is a non-profit, universal login service for humans.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>We are a Swiss non-profit association.</strong> We are not a for-profit company and have no shareholders. Our only mission is to protect your privacy.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>We verify your identity</strong> once using a secure check of your government ID. After that, you use your Agora pass to prove to websites that you're a real, verified human—or that you're over a certain age—without ever sharing your ID, your birthday, or other personal data.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>You log in securely.</strong> Platforms know you're human. Your private information is never shared or sold.
            </li>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Web is Overrun. We're Taking It Back.</h2>
        <p>
            Every <em>"Log in with..."</em> button is a trade. You get convenience; they get your data. Big Tech tracks your behavior, and platforms are drowning in bots, fakes, and manipulation. The old model is broken. We're building the new one.

        <p>
            Agora separates proof from data. Instead of handing over your personal files to every site, our one-time verification creates a secure "pass" that's yours to control.

        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold">We are a non-profit</h3>
        <p>
            Our mission is to protect you. We are a Swiss non-profit. We don't track you. We don't sell your data. We can't be bought. Our entire model is built on your trust, not your ad profile.

        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold">An end to the bot epidemic</h3>
        <p>
            This is bigger than a login. This is about building a web for humans. By using Agora, you support platforms that foster genuine conversation and starve the bot-driven economies that thrive on manipulation.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold">Your data stays yours</h3>
        <p>
            Prove your age without revealing your birthday. Prove your identity without showing your ID. Agora confirms your status to a site for you, so you never have to hand over your personal files again.
        </p>
